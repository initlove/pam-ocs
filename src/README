-1. prompt the server input
 0. check the url validation & if the url support OCS
 1. prompt login hint
 2. check login value
	--- simple, we check if it is less than 4 chars
	--- we donnot check if the 'user' was valid!
 3. prompt password hint
 4. check the password
	--- here, we donnot check the password locally(maybe will, in the future)
 5. validate the user/password

.. The end.


TODO:
1. in the login hint part, we can add hint for the client to open in mozilla. (oauth)
2. mkhomedir, session work

UNKNOWN:
1. can I implement in the client which is to add an user?
